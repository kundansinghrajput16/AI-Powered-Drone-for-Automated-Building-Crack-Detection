# üß† AI-Powered Drone for Automated Building Crack Detection

An **AI-powered drone system** designed for the **automatic detection of building facade cracks and structural anomalies**. This project integrates **computer vision**, **deep learning**, and **autonomous drone navigation** to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of **structural health monitoring (SHM)** in civil infrastructure.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Traditional crack detection methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This project introduces a **fully automated drone-based inspection framework** that combines **high-resolution imaging**, **autonomous flight planning**, and **AI-driven crack detection models** to identify and classify surface defects in buildings.

## üß© Key Features

* **Autonomous Drone Navigation:** Uses pre-defined flight paths or SLAM-based autonomous movement for area coverage.
* **High-Resolution Imaging:** Captures detailed fa√ßade images using onboard camera modules.
* **AI-Based Crack Detection:** Implements a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** model trained on crack datasets to detect and localize structural cracks.
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** Sends live video feed and analysis results to the control system or cloud dashboard.
* **Data Storage & Analysis:** Automatically stores inspection data for later review and maintenance planning.
